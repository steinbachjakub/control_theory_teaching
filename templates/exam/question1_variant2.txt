\question The system is described by the ODE given as
\begin{equation*}
\ddot{y}+{{a[0]}}\dot{y}+{{a[1]}}y=\dot{u}+{{b[0]}}u
\end{equation*}
Find the transfer function $H(s)$ and determine the poles, zeros and DC gain of the system. Find the impulse response $y(t)$ (assume zero initial conditions) of this system and assess the stability of the system, determining whether it is stable or unstable. (\textbf{10 points})
